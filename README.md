# Responsive Portfolio

## Building a portfolio that's not only informative but also responsive.

Creating one's self portfolio is not as easy as you may think, seems like it might be easier to make someone else's. However, it is a great opportunity to demonstrate your work and show off your skills by HOW you actually display it. 

 
In the about me tab you will find a brief description of me as well as a nice b&w picture.
This portfolio tab llustrates some of the work I have completed so far and some that are to be started very soon. 
The contact tab will lead you to a few input boxes where you can reach out and hire me for your next porject.


One of the biggest challenges of this assignment was making sure it was responsive to smaller devices such as phones and tablets. I can definetly say my skills were put to the test on this one but I'm very pleased with the outcome.
