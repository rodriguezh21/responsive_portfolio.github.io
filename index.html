          <p class="content">My name is Herson Rodriguez and I'm a Barber by profession and a Coding student at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. I was born in Honduras and grew up in Indianapolis, IN. I have been in the barbering industry for over 10 years now and it's something I am very passionate about. After so many years of trying to figure out where I wanted to go with my carrer, I can finally say that I have found the best shop to work in Chicago. This place makes me feel valued, appreciated, and also proud of how all the work that I have put into this profession is finally paying off. I am very comfortable where I'm at in my career which brings me to talk about Coding. I've always seen myself as a highly motivated person that hates to feel stuck and my fear is that in a few years I will feel that way about barbering. I used to see Coding the same way others see barbering, a talent that you develop in your youth years, and used to feel like my time to get started on it had passed. Now, after a few weeks of Coding classes I can say I was wrong. I'm looking forward to see where Coding is going to take me.
